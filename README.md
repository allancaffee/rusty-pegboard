# Rusty Pegboard

This is an implementation of the [Peg Solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire)
game written in Rust. My intention with writing this is to learn the Rust
programming language.

The game is simple enough that I think I can implement something that works
with a limitted understanding of Rust, but complicated enough that it will
force me to think about and learn appropriate software design in this new
language.
